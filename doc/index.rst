tobac - Tracking and Object-Based Analysis of Clouds
-----------

**tobac** is a Python package to identify, tracking and analysing clouds in different types of gridded datasets, i.e. 3D model output from cloud resolving model simulations or 2D data from satellite retrievals.

Individual features are indentified as either maxima or minima in a two dimensional time varying field. The volume/are associated with the identified object can be determined based on a time-varying 2D or 3D field and a threshold value. In the tracking step, the identified objects are linked into consistent trajectories representing the cloud over its lifecycle. Analysis and visualisation methods provide a convenient way to use and display the tracking results.


More detailed documentation will follow soon.
